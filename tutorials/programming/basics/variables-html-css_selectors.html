        <h1>Programming Basics: Variables, HTML, CSS Selectors</h1>

        <p>So I'm going to try to get straight to the core concepts of programming, and skip over getting buried by syntax rules. Every language has its own rules, but the concepts are universal. Here are a couple definitions:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>variable</dt>
            <dd>A named value. Think of a space, with some name on it. That's a variable. What you put inside it is the value. Think math "x = 5" or whatever, except x can equal a string, or an image, or anything.</dd>
            <dt>keyword</dt>
            <dd>Some words have special meaning to the computer, and you can't use them as a name for a variable. These are called keywords. An example common keyword is "function" which is often used to state what a function is. (Don't worry about "what" a function is yet.)</dd>
            <dt>object</dt>
            <dd>Essentially, a named collection of variables. (You will find different definitions for this, I'm using a <i>very</i> generic definition.)</dd>
            <dd>(also: "a block of stuff" in laymen's terms)</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>As long as you understand a "variable" is a thing that can hold some value, and a keyword is a word with special meaning to the computer, you're good to go. Here's some code:</p>

        <pre><code class="lua">
            info = {
                domain = {-100, 100},
                detail = 1
            }
        </code></pre>
        <!--This example from my other project: FnGraph, which is currently on hiatus.-->

        <p>So what does this do? Let's take it line by line:</p>

        <p><code>info = {</code> "info" is a variable name, the "=" means we're putting a value in it, and the "{" (bracket) means that it's going to be an object.</p>

        <p><code>domain = {-100, 100},</code> "domain" is another variable. We're putting a variable in an object. This variable is <i>itself</i> an object. The commas are used to tell the computer when we're done with one variable (or object) and are defining another. In this case, we're putting some numbers in here.</p>

        <p><code>detail = 1</code> Here we define one more variable with a one. As this is the last variable, we don't have a comma following it, but that's not important right now.</p>

        <p><code>}</code> And we're done. In this language, all brackets must pair up. (A lot of languages are like that!)</p>

        <p>If you're worrying about the rules or how that works at this point, stop. It would waste far too much time to try to go through all that right now. The main lesson here is that we have a block of stuff called "info", and within that block of stuff is a thing called "domain" with two numbers in it, and another thing called "detail" with the value of one.</p>

        <h2>Now, HTML</h2>

        <p>Let's start again with an example:</p>

        <pre><code class="html">
            &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;Page Title!&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;A Header&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>First, <b>what's the same</b>?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We have "objects" (though we now call them "elements" or "tags"). <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> all the way to <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is one big block of stuff - everything else is in there!</li>
            <li>We have <i>values</i>, like <code>A Header</code>. Some of these would show on the webpage if you opened it in a browser, <a href="../examples/barebones-html-page.html" target="_blank">like this</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Second, <b>what's different</b>?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We don't have <i>any</i> variables. We have "tags" defined by their keywords. Anything in angled brackets (the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols) is a keyword with specific meaning. (For a huge list of them with a lot of examples, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/" target="_blank">click here</a>.)</li>
            <li>This is a complete, useful document. The other example was "here's some data" without <i>doing</i> anything. HTML is about displaying data. You say what the data is by which tags you use, and the browser displays it according to rules about what each tag means.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At this point, you're probably wondering <b>what can I do?</b> and <b>what can I not do?</b></p>

        <!--<p>First, though, I want to clarify something: Tags are used by first opening the tag (the <code>&lt;bit&gt;</code> that looks like that, no <code>/</code> in front), and then, after putting whatever goes inside, closing the tag (the <code>&lt;/bit&gt;</code> with the <code>/</code> in front).</p>-->

        <p>What you can do is use any tag <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/" target="_blank">listed here</a> in any order, with anything within the <code>&lt;open&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/close&gt;</code> ends of the tag... except you can't. There are some specific rules with certain tags, and some tags don't have a closing tag.</p>

        <!--<p>If you want to go in-depth with HTML, <a href="">click here</a> to be taken to tutorial on HTML specifically.</p>-->

        <p>I will write a more in-depth tutorial about HTML and link to it here in the future.</p>

        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>

        <p>CSS is used to style websites. If you clicked on the <a href="../examples/barebones-html-page.html" target="_blank">example page</a> above, you noticed it was very bland. CSS is a langauge for modifying how HTML is displayed.</p>

        <p>(Real quick, a great introduction to CSS to read is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp" target="_blank">available here</a>. You could even read their full tutorial if you want, and you'll know more than the brief part I'm going over here.)</p>

        <pre><code class="css">
            * {
                color: red;
            }
            a.no_underline {
                text-decoration: none;
            }
            a .no_underline {
                text-decoration: none;
            }
        </code></pre>

        <p>Okay, there's a lot in here, but we're focusing on the <i>selectors</i>, which is the part before the brackets on each of these blocks. The first one (*) is pretty simple, it selects <i>everything</i>. In this case, we're telling everything to be <span style="color: red;">red</span>.</p>

        <p>The second one is a little more complicated. The first part (the "a") is selecting <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">"a" tags</a> (anchor tags). The period means that the text immediately following the period is a class name. In this case, we have a class named "no_underline".</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>class</dt>
            <dd>A class simply refers to a collection of tags that are similar in some way in what CSS wants to do with them.</dd>
            <dd>(There are some rules to how class names can be chosen, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/449000" target="_blank">like what's mentioned here</a>, just don't get bogged down in the details yet! (By the way, that's a great site for answers, but only as long as you <i>carefully</i> read responses, there's just as many wrong answers or bad answers as good ones!))</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>The next definition is the exact same thing, I'm just showing you that you can have a space there..but not after the period!</p>

        <pre><code class="css">
            p {
                font-size: 30px;
            }
            .class {
                color: blue;
            }
            .class {
                font-weight: bold;
            }
        </code></pre>

        <p>The "p" is just selecting another tag, this time the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">paragraph tag</a>. Next, to emphasize that you can re-use these selectors all over the place, we have two definitions of a class called "class". This is the same thing as:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">
            .class {
                color: blue;
                font-weight: bold;
            }
        </code></pre>

        <p>But sometimes, you need to combine a whole bunch of these!</p>

        <pre><code class="css">
            .blacklist > ol > li {
                background: black;
                /* this only selects ordered list items inside a "blacklist" class */
            }
        </code></pre>

        <p>Here's an example using a class and two tags<!-- (<code>ol</code> is an ordered list, <code>li</code> is a list item)-->, as well as <code>&gt;</code> which modifies the meaning of other selectors to say that we're looking for whatever is on the right, only if it is <i>in</i> what's on the left.</p>
