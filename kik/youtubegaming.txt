When a rule is broken the first time, you will be warned/reminded of the rules. Depending on severity/frequency of rule-breaking, you may or may not get a 2nd warning. Then you will be kicked, with the option to come back after an hour. If you come back within an hour of being kicked, or come back and immediately break the rules again, you will be banned.

Please let an admin know if you have any questions or recommendations for these rules.
