		<p>Telltale Games have a common element of choice, and more specifically choices that must be made within a time limit. I am curious to see what happens if you fail to answer every timed choice in each game, and want to do a YouTube series on it called "Guard Indecisively Plays".</p>
		<p>Here's how it would work: I livestream playing the game (while also recording it). Every quick time event that is "save yourself" or "save someone" or something I will do like normal, but any time there is a dialogue timed choice, I will ignore it and run out of time. Any time there is an untimed choice, I will post a strawpoll for the people watching live to decide what I choose.</p>
		<p>This poll is to ask what you think of the idea, so I know whether or not it is worth going through with the effort. (I'll probably do it anyhow, but I at least want to know if it's something I can expect to keep doing or something I'll have to give up on pretty quickly.)</p>
