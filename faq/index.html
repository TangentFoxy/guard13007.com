        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p>I get asked some questions a lot more often than others...so here are those answers:</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>YouTube</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>What are your computer's specs?</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CPU</b>: FX-6300 (6-core 3.5 GHz AMD)</li>
                    <li><b>GPU</b>: HD-7850 (1 GB VRAM, AMD)</li>
                    <li><b>RAM</b>: 16 GB DDR3 (1600 MHz or whatever)</li>
                    <li><b>SSD</b>: Samsung Evo 840 something (250 GB)</li>
                    <li><b>HDD</b>: WD Blue 1 TB 7200rpm 64 MB cache (x2)</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>When is the next Plane Reviews episode?</dt>
            <dd>When I have the time to make it. It takes several hours to make each one, and I don't have a solid chunk of time for that as often as I used to.</dd>

            <dt>What KSP mods are you using?</dt>
            <dd>That changes often, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Guard13007/5ef8446c40d7a0f312c3">here is a list</a> of all mods I use, sorted into categories.</dd>

            <dt>How do I send you a plane?</dt>
            <dd><b>Preferred method</b>: Upload it to <a href="https://kerbalx.com/" target="_blank">KerbalX</a> and add it to my public hanger. Their interface is really bad, but it looks <a href="images/public-hanger.png" target="_blank">like this</a> (after clicking "add to hanger" and then "add to open hanger" from your craft's page).<br/><br/>

                <b>Alternate method</b>: Send an email to <a href="mailto:GuardAlmostGames@gmail.com">GuardAlmostGames@gmail.com</a> with the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Download link or .craft file (preferably on KerbalX)</li>
                    <li>List of mods used (preferably with links)</li>
                    <li>Version of KSP it was made in</li>
                    <li>Name to call you (else I will use whatever your email uses, which you may not want)</li>
                    <li>Any other notes you want</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Did you get my email? Why didn't you reply to my email?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. I don't reply to plane submissions and I often don't have time to reply to other emails.</dd>

            <dt>Why do you say "Kerbal Space-gram" instead of "Kerbal Space Program"?</dt>
            <dd>I say "pro" very quiet and fast. In combination with the bassy sound of "pro" and my post-processing to remove background noise (which is also bassy), this makes the "pro" usually inaudible. If you <a href="images/exhibit-a.png" target="_blank">look at the waveforms</a> though, you can see it's there.</dd>
